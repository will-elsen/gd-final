        Our main logo is the wooden staff with the magenta gemstone and light violet aura. This is the logo used for the majority of our marketing material, our brand merch, and is present on many of the pages of our home website. The logo displays our magical approach to web design, and also the power that good web design carries. The area of the staff within the violet aura should never be covered or combined with anything else. The handle section of the staff can be covered, placed inside something or held, but never modified. The staff should also always be one of three colors: the magenta/violet color that is the main logo, the sunshine yellow/thin yellow of the staff that represents our security, or the deep blue/blueberry of the functionality staff and golem. The staff should never have any other colors for the gem or aura.
