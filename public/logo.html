      <div class="info-text logo-text" style="white-space: pre-line">Web Wizardry has three main logos, each involving a staff with a different color. They each are associated with a different one of Web Wizardry's colors. The main staff should never have different colors than Rich Magenta and Thin Violet. Similarly, the Golem should never havae colors different from Deep Blue and Blueberry, and the Security Shield should never have colors except for Sunshine Yellow and Lemon. The staff is associated in our branding with our design philosophy, the golem is associated with our excellent functionality, and the security shield is associated with our tight web security. Certain parts of each logo are allowed to be covered. The pedestal, flair, and handle of the purple staff may be covered, but the main aura, gem, and staff loop should always be fully visible. No part of the Golem's body or staff may be covered, but the crate may be replaced with any item, and the pedestal and flair may be obscured. The security shield may have the pedestal, bubble, and flair partially obscured, and the items within the bubble may be replaced with anything valuable.
